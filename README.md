### AnonChat

This is a training exercise integrating websockets and push notifications between
React, React Native, and NodeJS.  It is modeled after IRC.

### Roadmap

- [ ] Messages synced between server and multiple clients
- [ ] Traffic over HTTPS
- [ ] User-creatable channels
- [ ] Lightweight user registration
- [ ] Cross-server message propagation
- [ ] Redux state management
- [ ] Emoji and multimedia messages
- [ ] Channel ops
- [ ] No logs or message persistence -- when the server shuts down, all message history is lost

### Technologies

- React and React Native
- React-Redux
- Socket.IO
- Parse?  Firebase?  Something for push notifications
